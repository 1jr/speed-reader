# ![Speed Reader Logo](res/hdpi.png) Speed Reader

**Speed Reader App built in JavaScript with Apache Cordova**

Speed Reader lets you input a text and then plays it back one word at a time at a ridiculous speed. It calculates the speed based on the number of characters in the word, which makes it a better reading experience than many other speed readers. This is a proof of concept and needs more work, but feel free to tinker. The code is MIT.
